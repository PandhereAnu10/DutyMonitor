## Problem Statement :

#### This problem statement has been derived from the KAVACH HACKATHON 2k23, with the goal of addressing a practical issue in the real world.

<b>Problem Statement :</b>
```
KVH-013 - Tool for monitoring ground personnel
```

<b>Description :</b> 
```
Platform/tool to remotely track police officers deployed to bandobast duty using
NFC(Near Field Communication)to ensure that they stay where they are posted.
```

<b>Domain Bucket :</b> 
```
Asset Tracking
```

## Proposed Solution :

<b>NFC Check-In/Check-Out System:</b>
   - Equip each police officer with an NFC-enabled badge or card.
   - Install NFC readers at strategic locations at assigned posts.
   - Officers must tap their NFC badge on the reader when they arrive at their post (check-in) and 
when they leave (check-out).

<b>Attendance Recording:</b>
   - Integrate the NFC data with a centralized attendance recording system.
   - This system should log the time and location of each check-in and check-out, ensuring real-time
tracking.

<b>Geotagged Image Upload:</b>
   - Require officers to take geotagged images with their smartphones when they check-in at their assigned posts.
   - Implement an app that automatically uploads these images to a secure server.
   - Admin can view these images to verify the officer's presence at the assigned location.

By implementing this solution, it can effectively enhance productivity, efficiency, and security in 
the policing of bandobast duties. It provides a reliable and automated method for tracking officer 
movements and ensures they stay at their assigned posts, ultimately contributing to improved law 
and order in the society.
